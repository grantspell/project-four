## Planning

Dilettante : Exploring Art Fusion

My application's concept is to provide art enthusiasts with a workspace to create mood boards as collections where they can choose a visual piece by an artist, attach an audio file to the collection and write a brief summary explaining their thoughts, feelings, inspiration, etc. from and about the collection.
